# summer-starter

This project is built on the Villanelle project : https://github.com/owaisiqbal91/villanelle
This project used the sigma.js library.

Expectation:
When input 1, the program should show a graph with single node.
When input 2, the program should show a graph with two connected nodes.
When input 3, the program should show a graph with three randomly connected nodes. There will be a path between any two nodes.
When input 4, the program should show a graph with four randomly connected nodes. There will be a path between any two nodes.
When input 5, the program should show a graph with five randomly connected nodes. There will be a path between any two nodes.
So on.

Since it's random, from input 3, each time it should produce a different graph.
